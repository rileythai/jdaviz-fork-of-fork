Displaying Spectra
******************

Spectra loaded by the user will be automatically displayed in the viewer, 
although additional spectra loaded after the first may not be fully shown 
if they exceed the bounds of the plotted area, which are set based on the 
first displayed spectrum. The bounds can be changed via the 
:ref:`Pan/Zoom <pan-zoom>` tool or by deselecting the current spectra and 
selecting a different spectrum for display. Spectra generated by plugins 
(e.g a spectrum generated by the Gaussian Smooth plugin) will generally be 
automatically displayed as well, and one can always see the spectra 
available and toggle their visibility in the data selection dropdown menu 
(see :ref:`Selecting Data Set<selecting-data-set>` for more detail).

Selecting Data Set
==================

Data can be selected and de-selected by clicking on the "hammer and screwdriver" icon at the top left of an image viewer. Then, click the "gear" icon to access the "Data" tab. Here, you can click a checkbox next to the listed data to make the data visible (checked) or invisible (unchecked).

Pan/Zoom
========

There are several ways to pan or zoom in on spectral features of interest.

Interactive Pan/Zoom (Desktop App interface)
--------------------------------------------
You can find the following Pan/Zoom tools available in the tool drawer of the viewer:

2D Bidirectional Pan/Zoom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :guilabel: `2D Pan/Zoom` icon allows you to zoom using the scroll wheel. The window will zoom into the area around your cursor:

.. image:: ../img/SpecViz_2D_Zoom.gif
    :alt: Zooming in Specviz with the Scroll Wheel

To pan, simply click and drag the window.

Horizontal/Vertical Zoom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :guilabel:`Horizontal` and :guilabel:`Vertical` Zoom tools allow you to zoom along each axis, while locking the other.  You can also zoom by scrolling.

API Pan/Zoom (Notebook interface)
---------------------------------
The Specviz helper contains a set of convenience methods to programmatically define the view of the spectrum viewer. You may instantiate a Specviz Helper via:

>>> from jdaviz import SpecViz
>>> # Instantiate an instance of SpecViz
>>> SpecViz = SpecViz()
>>> # Display SpecViz
>>> SpecViz.app #doctest: +SKIP

Limit methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use the methods :py:func:`SpecViz.x_limits()` and :py:func:`SpecViz.y_limits()` to modify the field of view of Specviz. You can provide a scalar (which assumes the units of the loaded spectra), an Astropy Quantity, or 'auto' to automatically scale
::

>>> SpecViz.x_limits() #doctest: +SKIP
>>> SpecViz.x_limits(650*u.nm,750*u.nm) #doctest: +SKIP
>>> SpecViz.y_limits('auto', 110.0) #doctest: +SKIP

Additionally, you can provide the limit methods with a `~specutils.SpectralRegion`. Specviz shall set the bounds the upper and lower bounds of the SpectralRegion

>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> from specutils import SpectralRegion
>>> bounds = SpectralRegion(0.45*u.nm, 0.6*u.nm)
>>> SpecViz.x_limits(bounds) #doctest: +SKIP

Autoscale methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also quickly return to the default zoom using :py:func:`SpecViz.autoscale_x()` and :py:func:`SpecViz.autoscale_y()`

Axis Orientation methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To quickly flip an axis to change to and from ascending/descending, use :py:func:`SpecViz.flip_x()` and :py:func:`SpecViz.flip_y()`

Defining Spectral Regions
=========================

Spectral regions can be defined by clicking on the "hammer and screwdriver" icon at the top left of an image
viewer. Then, click the "region" icon to set the cursor dragging function in "spectral region selection" mode.

.. image:: img/spectral_region_1.png

Now, you can move the mouse to one of the end points (in wavelength) of the region you want to select, and drag
it to the other end point. The selected region background will display in light gray color, and the spectral trace
in color, coded to subset number.

You also see in the top tool bar that the region was added to the data hold, and is named "Subset 1".

.. image:: img/spectral_region_2.png

Clicking on that selector, you can add more regions by selecting the "create new" entry:

.. image:: img/spectral_region_3.png

Now just select the end points of the new region as before. It will be added to the data hold with name "Subset 2":

.. image:: img/spectral_region_4.png

In a notebook cell, you can access the regions using the `get_spectral_regions()` function:

Plot Settings
=============

To access plot settings for a particular viewer (including the spectrum viewer), click the :guilabel:`hammer and screwdriver` icon, followed by the :guilabel:`gear` icon, followed by the  :guilabel:`Layer` tab.

.. image:: img/specviz_plot_settings.png

Layer
-----

The top section of the :guilabel:`Layer` tab contains options to change the color of the spectrum (click the :guilabel:`square` icon to see a color change menu), change visibility of the spectrum (:guilabel:`eye` icon), and a drop-down box to select which layer will have its settings changed.

Line Width
----------

Width of the spectrum in pixels. Larger values correspond to thicker lines on the plot.

Vmin and Vmax
-------------

Minimum and maximum values of the y axis.

Percentile
----------

Sets the bounds of the plot (Vmin and Vmax) such that the selected percentage of the data is shown in the viewer. Editing either bound manually changes the "Percentile" selection to "Custom."
